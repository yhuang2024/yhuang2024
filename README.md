## Welcome to my page! 🪴🦜☀️

- 👋 Hi, I’m Yuyuan! I study Computer Science and International and Public Affairs at Brown University.
- 💻 My interests lie in human-computer interaction. Some of my favorite topics within this field are socially responsible computing, technology policy, product/system design, AI/NLP, frontend development, and robotics.
- 📚 This semester I'm taking courses on urban politics, computational linguistics, and advanced algorithms. I'm also a robotics lead for Brown Space Engineering and conduct research for the Brown Human-Computer Interaction Lab under Dr. Jeff Huang.
- 🫶 Outside of work, I like to write poetry, read, take photos, hike, run, and learn new languages.
- 📫 Reach out to me at yuyuan_huang@brown.edu!
